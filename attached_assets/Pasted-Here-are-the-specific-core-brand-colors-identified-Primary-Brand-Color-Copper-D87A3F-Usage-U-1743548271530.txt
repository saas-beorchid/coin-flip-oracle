Specific Types of Typography
The typography is based on Tailwind CSS defaults and custom styles in globals.css. Here’s the breakdown:
Primary Font Family: Arial, sans-serif  
Usage: Defined in globals.css (font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;) as the base font for the body.

Purpose: Provides a clean, modern, and widely supported sans-serif typeface for general readability.

Font Sizes and Weights:
Headings: 
text-2xl (24px) for section titles (e.g., legal page headings).

text-xl (20px) for subsections (e.g., legal document sections).

text-7xl (72px) for the logo on the homepage (logo class in globals.css).

Body Text: 
text-sm (14px) and text-base (16px) for paragraphs and subtext (e.g., landing page heading, legal text).

Font Weights: 
font-bold (700) for headings and key terms.

font-semibold (600) for secondary headings and buttons.

font-medium (500) for the logo text.

Line Height and Spacing:
leading-relaxed (line-height: 1.5) used for body text to improve readability.

Custom line-height: 1.5 in the landing page heading for consistency.

Purpose: The typography hierarchy ensures clarity, with larger, bold fonts for emphasis (e.g., brand name, legal titles) and smaller, lighter fonts for detailed content, aligning with a professional yet approachable AI platform.

Responsive Grid
The responsive grid is implemented using Tailwind CSS’s utility classes, with custom adjustments in globals.css. Here’s the structure:
Grid System:
Base Layout: flex flex-col for vertical stacking on all pages, with flex items-center justify-center for centering content.

Container Width: max-w-md (max 28rem) for forms and cards, max-w-3xl (max 48rem) for legal pages, and max-w-4xl (max 64rem) for pricing cards, ensuring adaptability.

Breakpoints:
md:grid-cols-3 (min-width: 768px) for the pricing page to switch to a three-column layout.

md:text-base (min-width: 768px) to increase text size on larger screens (e.g., landing page heading).

w-[90%] in the homepage search container to scale with viewport width.

Responsive Adjustments:
p-4 (1rem padding) on all pages for consistent spacing.

space-y-4 and space-x-4 for vertical and horizontal gaps in forms and lists.

mt-6, mb-4, etc., for margin control, adapting to content density.

Purpose: The grid ensures a fluid, user-friendly layout across devices, from mobile (320px) to desktop (1280px), with Tailwind’s mobile-first approach and custom breakpoints enhancing the cinematic experience.

Accessibility Standards
Accessibility has been considered through the implementation, aligning with WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines where possible. Here’s the breakdown:
Color Contrast:
High contrast between text (#FFFFFF, #9CA3AF) and backgrounds (#000000, #4B5563) meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (e.g., 4.5:1 for normal text).

Copper (#D87A3F) and gold (#FFD700) accents are used sparingly for links and highlights, ensuring sufficient contrast.

Keyboard Navigation:
All interactive elements (buttons, links) are focusable (focus:ring-2 focus:ring-copper) and operable via keyboard, meeting WCAG 2.1 Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard).

Example: The "GET STARTED" button and admin form inputs.

Semantic HTML:
Use of <h1>, <h2>, <p>, and <ul> tags in legal pages and forms provides a logical structure, aiding screen readers (WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships).

Links (e.g., email addresses) include href attributes for navigation.

Text Alternatives:
Buttons and icons (e.g., social icons in the footer) should have aria-label attributes (e.g., aria-label="GitHub"), though this can be enhanced. Current implementation uses lucide-react icons with labels.

Responsive Design:
The responsive grid and typography adjustments ensure content is accessible on all screen sizes, meeting WCAG 1.4.10 (Reflow).

Limitations and Enhancements:
Missing ARIA Labels: Some interactive elements lack explicit aria-label or aria-describedby attributes.

Form Accessibility: Inputs lack aria-required or error messaging for accessibility.

Recommendation: Add ARIA attributes and improve form feedback in the next iteration.
